<h1>Student Spring Boot Project</h1>

<p>This Is A Simple <b>REST API</b> Made With Spring Boot.</p>

<p>It Has Only One End Point => <b>/api/students</b>.</p>

<p>At This End Point We Can Do <b>CRUD</b> Operations.</p>

<p><b>GET</b> Requests To This End Point Will Retrieve All Students.</p>

<p><b>POST</b> Requests To This End Point Will Register A New Student.</p>

<p><b>PUT</b> Requests To This End Point Will Update A Student's Email Or Password.</p>

<p><b>DELETE</b> Requests To This End Point Will Delete A Student.</p>

<p>In This Project I've Used <b>Postgresql</b> As My Database.</p>

<p>Also In This Project I've Used <b>Hibernate And Spring Data JPA</b>.</p>
